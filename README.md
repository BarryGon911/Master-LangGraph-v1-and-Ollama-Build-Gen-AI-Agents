# [Master LangGraph v1 and Ollama - Build Production‑Grade GenAI Agents](https://github.com/BarryGon911/Master-LangGraph-v1-and-Ollama-Build-Gen-AI-Agents/)

A comprehensive, modern, and industry‑ready course designed to teach you
how to build **real AI agents** using **LangGraph v1**, **LangChain
v1**, **Ollama**, and state‑of‑the‑art open‑source LLMs such as
**Qwen3**, **Gemma3**, **GPT‑OSS**, and **DeepSeek**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 What You Will Learn

### **Ollama & Open‑Source LLMs**

-   Install and integrate Ollama with LangChain v1\
-   Run and benchmark models: Qwen3, Gemma3, GPT‑OSS, DeepSeek‑R1,
    custom GGUF models\
-   Perform fast document analysis, context inspection, and realtime
    search\
-   Use advanced Ollama commands and create custom models

### **LangChain v1 Fundamentals**

-   Configure LangSmith, LangFuse, and Opik for tracing\
-   Build pipelines with ChatOllama, ChatPromptTemplate, runnables, and
    Pydantic output models\
-   Structure reusable prompts and build reliable LLM workflows

### **LangGraph: Beginner → Advanced**

-   Understand flow engineering, node design, reducers, and state
    management\
-   Build nested nodes, conditional routing, and complete multi‑step
    graphs\
-   Visualize and execute graphs while monitoring state evolution

### **Conditional Routing**

-   Build sentiment classifiers with Pydantic\
-   Route message flows based on positive/negative results\
-   Construct fully operational sentiment analysis graphs

### **ReAct Agents with LangGraph**

-   Implement Chain‑of‑Thought and Tree‑of‑Thought patterns\
-   Build tool‑enabled agents (weather, calculator, utilities)\
-   Manage agent memory, debugging, conditional execution, and state
    updates

### **Agent Memory & Streaming**

-   Use MemorySaver and memory notebooks\
-   Stream agent output and restore conversation history\
-   Implement separation of short‑term and long‑term memory

### **Persistent Memory (SQLite & PostgreSQL)**

-   Store chat memory in SQLite\
-   Configure free PostgreSQL databases\
-   Implement semantic retrieval and memory tools

### **Long‑Term Memory Systems**

-   Store, fetch, and delete long‑term memory\
-   Build semantic search pipelines\
-   Add dedicated memory tools for agents

### **Interrupts & Human‑in‑the‑Loop**

-   Add guardrails and PII protection\
-   Build approval‑based workflows (e.g., money transfers)\
-   Implement HITL nodes, routers, and persistent state tracking

### **Reflection & Research Agents**

-   Build autonomous researcher and critique loops\
-   Integrate free web search tools\
-   Add self‑evaluation and reasoning cycles

### **MySQL ReAct Agent**

-   Connect LangGraph to MySQL\
-   Auto‑extract schema and generate SQL with validation\
-   Build error‑correction and safe execution pipelines\
-   Benchmark Qwen3 vs GPT‑OSS for database workloads

### **MCP with Airbnb MCP Server**

-   Understand the Model Context Protocol\
-   Build MCP‑powered LangGraph agents\
-   Run workflows directly inside Jupyter notebooks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧑‍💻 Who This Course Is For

-   Developers and engineers exploring agentic architectures\
-   Data scientists & ML engineers building retrieval‑based AI systems\
-   Students and beginners with basic Python skills\
-   Professionals building enterprise‑ready GenAI solutions\
-   AI enthusiasts wanting to move beyond simple chatbots

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌟 Why This Course Stands Out

-   Beginner‑friendly explanations with production‑grade workflows\
-   Full coverage: LLMs → LangChain → LangGraph → Agents → Memory →
    Databases\
-   Hands‑on coding in every module\
-   Updated for **2026** with the latest ecosystem changes\
-   No API costs using fully local open‑source models

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 By the End of This Course, You Will Be Able To:

-   Build complete, stateful AI agents with LangGraph\
-   Integrate tools, databases, APIs, and real‑world workflows\
-   Implement short‑term and long‑term memory\
-   Add guardrails, HITL approvals, and routing\
-   Deploy local LLMs with Ollama for production environments\
-   Develop robust GenAI applications built for real‑world use
