Descripción
**Brand New 2026 Version**

This course has been re-designed, re-recorded, and rebuilt from the ground up to support

**LangChain v1+, LangGraph v1+, latest frameworks, and modern agentic workflows.**

Master LangGraph v1 and Ollama – Build Gen AI Agents is a complete and beginner-friendly course for anyone who wants to build real AI agents using LangGraph, LangChain, Ollama, and open source LLMs like GPT-OSS, Qwen3 and Gemma3.

This course starts from the basics. You will understand every concept step by step and build fully working AI agent systems with real tools, memory, routing, and database integration.

By the end of the course, you will be able to build production-ready AI agents that can search the web, call tools, interact with databases, store memories, follow human approval steps, and solve real-world tasks.

Every lecture includes a live demo and a working example to help you learn through hands-on experience.
